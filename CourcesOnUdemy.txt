Great 👌 since you’ve already **done Java**, the next step depends on where you want to go with your career (Backend Developer, Full-Stack, Automation Tester, Data Engineer, etc.).

Here’s a **roadmap with Udemy course suggestions** after Java 👇

---

## 🚀 1. Backend Development (Java Developer Path)

If you want to stick with Java for backend jobs:

* **Spring & Spring Boot** → *Spring & Hibernate for Beginners (includes Spring Boot)* by Chad Darby
* **Microservices** → *Master Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud* by in28Minutes Official
* **REST APIs** → *REST API Development with Spring Boot*
* **Databases** → *SQL & MySQL for Beginners* or *PostgreSQL for Everybody*
* **Cloud** → *AWS for Java Developers* (by in28Minutes)

---

## 🌐 2. Full-Stack Development

If you want both **frontend + backend**:

* **Spring Boot + Angular** → *Full Stack Java Developer with Spring Boot & Angular*
* **Spring Boot + React** → *Full Stack Project Development with Spring Boot and React*
* **Frontend separately**:

  * *React - The Complete Guide* by Maximilian Schwarzmüller
  * or *Angular - The Complete Guide* by Maximilian Schwarzmüller

---

## 🤖 3. Automation Testing (QA Path with Java)

If you like testing + automation:

* **Selenium WebDriver with Java** → *Selenium WebDriver with Java - Basics to Advanced + Frameworks*
* **RestAssured** → *API Testing with RestAssured* (in28Minutes)
* **Cucumber / BDD** → *Cucumber with Selenium & Java*

---

## 📊 4. Data Engineering / Big Data with Java

If you want to explore **data side**:

* *Apache Kafka for Beginners*
* *Apache Spark with Java*
* *Big Data Essentials with Hadoop and MapReduce*

---

## 🧠 5. CS Fundamentals (Interview Prep)

* *Data Structures and Algorithms in Java*
* *System Design Interview Preparation*

---

👉 So your “next step” depends on **career direction**:

* **Backend Java Developer** → Spring Boot + Microservices + SQL + Cloud
* **Full Stack** → Spring Boot + React/Angular
* **QA Automation** → Selenium + RestAssured + Cucumber
* **Data Engineering** → Kafka + Spark + Hadoop

Do you want me to make a **step-by-step Udemy learning path** (like: “Month 1 → take this course, Month 2 → that course”) based on your goal?



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good thinking — if you go full stack, you’ll have to add frontend hours (React / HTML / CSS / JavaScript) on top of the backend + Java stack hours. Let me break down a rough estimate for the **full stack path** (based on the courses you listed) plus some typical frontend courses, so you can see how much total time you might need.

## 🎯 Courses in Full Stack Path & Their Approx Hours

Here are some real Udemy course hour stats for React / frontend courses and estimates for full stack combos:

| Course                                                                           | Approx Video / Lecture Hours                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **React – The Complete Guide** (incl Next.js, Redux) by Maximilian Schwarzmüller | ~ **71h 22m** ([Udemy][1])                                                                                   |
| **The Ultimate React Course 2025: React, Next.js, Redux & More**                 | ~ **84 hours** ([Udemy][2])                                                                                  |
| **Full Stack Java Development with Spring Boot & React**                         | (Hands-on course) — doesn’t always list exact hours, but likely in the range of **25-40 hours** ([Udemy][3]) |
| **Java Full Stack: React and Spring Boot – Expense App**                         | (Comprehensive full stack) — likely 25-40 hours or more ([Udemy][4])                                         |

## 🧮 Estimate for Full Stack + Backend Stack Combined

From your previous backend estimate, you had **~ 125 hours** for:

* Spring & Hibernate
* Microservices
* Hibernate & JPA
* REST APIs
* AWS Dev Associate

Now, to go full stack, you add:

* React / frontend courses (~ 70–80 hours)
* Full stack integration courses (Spring Boot + React) (~ 25-40 hours)
* HTML / CSS / JavaScript basics (if needed) — maybe ~ 10-20 hours

So adding up:

| Part                               | Hours Estimate      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Backend / Java stack (as before)   | ~ 125h              |
| React / frontend & JS / CSS / HTML | ~ 70-80h            |
| Full Stack integration / projects  | ~ 25-40h            |
| Total (video / lecture time)       | **~ 220-245 hours** |

Then, plus time for **practice, projects, debugging, review** — realistically, you might spend **250-300 hours** or more to be comfortable and job-ready in full stack.

If you like, I can pick the **exact courses** (for India) you would take in the full stack path you listed, fetch their **current video + assignment hours**, and compute a precise total for your path. Do you want me to get that precise number for you?
